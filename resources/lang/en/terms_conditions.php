                        <p>You acknowledge that portions of the Services may be made available under Lady Driver App\'s various brands or booking options associated with transportation. You also acknowledge that the Services may be made available under such brands, booking, or request options by or in connection with:</p>

                        <p>When rendering our services, the information that we disclose is based on the information provided to us by the users. As such, the users are fully responsible for informing us with their updated information and indicate directly by themselves if they are available which is displayed on our software. Although we will use reasonable skill and care in performing our Lady Driver App Taxi services, we will not verify if, and cannot guarantee that, all information is accurate, complete, or correct, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and typographical errors), any interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of our software or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-delivery of information. Each user remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness, and correctness of the (descriptive) information displayed on our software. Our software does not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement of the quality, service level, or rating of any user made available.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Services may be made available or accessed in connection with third-party services and content (including advertising) that Lady Driver App Taxi does not control. You acknowledge that different terms of use and privacy policies may apply to your use of such third-party services and content. Lady Driver App Taxi does not endorse such third-party services and content and in no event shall Lady Driver App Taxi be responsible or liable for any products or services of such third-party providers. These third-party beneficiaries are not parties to this contract and are not responsible for the provision or support of the Services in any manner. Your access to the Services using these devices is subject to terms set forth in the applicable third-party beneficiary’s terms of service.</p>
                        
                        <p>Our services are made available for personal and non-commercial use only. Therefore, you are not allowed to re-sell, deep-link, use, copy, monitor (e.g. spider, scrape), display, download, or reproduce any content or information, software, products, or services available on our software for any commercial or competitive activity or purpose.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Fees & Payment</h2>
                        <p>Our service to the passengers is free of charge. We will not charge you for our service or add any additional (booking) fees to your ride.</p>
                        
                        <p>You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services you receive from a Third Party Provider (“Charges”). After you have received services obtained through your use of the Services, Lady Driver App Taxi will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider as a disclosed payment collection agent for the Third Party Provider (as Principal). Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Lady Driver App Taxi. Lady Driver App Taxi will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service.</p>
                        
                        <p>All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated as soon as practicable by Lady Driver App using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which Lady Driver App Taxi will send you a notification by email. The third-party provider is obliged to issue the receipt. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid, or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Lady Driver App Taxi may, as the Third Party Provider’s disclosed payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.</p>
                        
                        <p>As between you and Lady Driver App Taxi, reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Lady Driver App Taxi sole discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. Lady Driver App Taxi will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. Lady Driver App Taxi may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services or goods from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party Provider’s arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee.</p>
                        
                        <p>This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services provided. Lady Driver App Taxi does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. Any representation by LADY DRIVER App (on Lady Driver App Taxi website, in the Application, or in Lady Driver App marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is “voluntary,” “not required,” and/or “included” in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that Lady Driver App Taxi provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Third Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third Party Provider.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Termination</h2>
                        <p>We reserve the right to terminate your access to our services and this Agreement if you violate these terms and conditions or any other legal obligations you are bound to.</p>
