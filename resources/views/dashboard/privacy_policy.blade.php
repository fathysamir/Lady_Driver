                        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

                        <p>Welcome to Lady Driver. This privacy policy outlines how we handle your personal data when using Lady Driver’s services (referred to as "you" or "your"). In Egypt, Lady Driver is managed and controlled by Lady Driver (referred to as "we" or "us").</p>
                    
                        <p>This policy applies whenever you use Lady Driver's websites, mobile apps, products, or services (collectively, the "Platform" or "Lady Driver") or when you contact us. It does not cover the information we process related to candidates, employees, or business partners.</p>
                    
                        <p>We ensure compliance with applicable local laws in the way we handle your data. If this policy conflicts with any local law, the local law takes precedence to the extent of the inconsistency.</p>
                    
                        <p>Passengers are users who request or receive transportation, logistics, or courier services via Lady Driver. Drivers are those providing these services to Passengers.</p>
                    
                        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                        
                        <h3>We collect three types of information:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Information you provide</li>
                            <li>Information we collect automatically</li>
                            <li>Information we obtain from other sources</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>We do not collect sensitive personal data such as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or information related to sex life or sexual orientation.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
                        
                        <p>When registering as a Passenger, you provide your first name, phone number, email, country, and city. Where required by law, we may ask for additional information like selfies for security checks, ID numbers, and emergency contacts. Without providing this information, you may not be able to use Lady Driver or some features. Optionally, you can provide your last name and profile picture.</p>
                        
                        <p>Drivers provide additional information, including their full name, profile picture, license details, vehicle information, identification documents, and banking details. We may also collect criminal record checks where required. Authorized vendors may process some of this data on our behalf. Without this information, you cannot register as a Driver.</p>
                        
                        <p>Other types of user-provided information include content uploaded on the platform (e.g., reviews), correspondence through emails or phone calls, and information for promotional programs (e.g., referral bonuses).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
                    
                        <p>We collect location data, transaction information (e.g., ride details), usage patterns, and communications data. Device-specific information such as your device model, IP address, language settings, and operating system is also collected. We assign user and trip IDs for tracking.</p>
                    
                        <h3>Information We Obtain from Other Sources</h3>
